# Club Images Directory

## Image Requirements
- **Size**: 30px x 30px (exactly)
- **Format**: PNG (recommended) or JPG
- **Background**: Transparent or solid color
- **Quality**: High resolution for crisp display

## Naming Convention
Club images must be named exactly as follows (lowercase, spaces replaced with hyphens):

### Examples:
- `manchester-united.png`
- `real-madrid.png`
- `barcelona.png`
- `liverpool.png`
- `bayern-munich.png`
- `psg.png`
- `chelsea.png`
- `arsenal.png`

## How to Add Images
1. Create or find a 30x30px image for each club
2. Name the file according to the club name (see examples above)
3. Upload the image to this directory (`images/clubs/`)
4. The marker will automatically use the image

## Fallback
If no image is found for a club, the marker will display as a colored circle with the club's color.

## Current Clubs in Database
Check the `clubs` array in `script.js` to see all club names and their expected image filenames.
